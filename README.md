# MVirus

MVirus is an unofficial modification for [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/). It downloads mods from the server to the client. The mod should be installed on both the client and the server to work.

# Supported mods
The mod supports all mods that don't use client-side DLLs. This includes:

* Custom models, textures, sounds from *.unity3d files
* UI atlases for items
* POI

# Compatibility
* EAC isnâ€™t supported. Disable it in server settings and game launcher.
* The mod tested on v1.2 (b27) and v1.3 (b9). We have no info about old game versions.
* MVirus works on dedicated servers and local hosts. (From 1.0.0)

# Installation

## Client

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/TheNormalnij/7DTD-MVirus/releases).
2. Unpack the archive into your `7 Days to Die/Mods` folder.
3. Enable mod sharing in `config.xml` if you want to share your mods.

## Server

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/TheNormalnij/7DTD-MVirus/releases).
2. Unpack the archive into your `7 Days to Die Dedicated Server/Mods` folder.
3. Enable mod sharing in `config.xml`.

# Configuration
MVirus is configured to download mods only by default.
You can change the configuration based on your needs in `config.xml`.

### You want to download mods only
* This option is used by default.
* Set the `ShareMods` property to `false`.
* This fixes a protocol error when your friend without MVirus trying to connect to your local server.

### You want to share mods with friend on LAN or the same Wi-Fi network
* Set the `ShareMods` property to `true`.
* Set the `FileTransferType` property to `0` to enable internal HTTP server.
* Disable all compression options.
* Disable the `CacheAllRemoteFiles` property to disk space.
* Allow your internal HTTP server port from `HttpPort` in firewall rules.

### You host a server (local or dedicated) without an additional HTTP server.
* You need public IP for this.
* Set the `ShareMods` property to `true`.
* Set the `FileTransferType` property to `0` to enable internal HTTP server.
* Enable static compression in `StaticCompression`.
* Open ports on your router for the internal HTTP server. Check the port in the `HttpPort` property.
* Allow the port in firewall rules

### You have an external HTTP server for files.
* Set the `ShareMods` property to `true`.
* Set the `FileTransferType` property to `1` to use external HTTP server.
* Change the `ExternalHTTPServerAddr` property with your HTTP server address.
* Enable static compression in `StaticCompression`.
* Enable `CacheAllRemoteFiles`.
* Sync the `HttpServerFiles` folder with you HTTP server.

### You host a local server without public IP.
* This option provides poor download speeds for your players compared to an HTTP server.

* Set the `FileTransferType` property to `2`.
* Enable static compression in `StaticCompression`.
